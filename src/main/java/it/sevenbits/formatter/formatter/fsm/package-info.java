/**
 * This package contains {@link it.sevenbits.formatter.formatter.IFormatter} implementation that is based
 * on finite-state machine and "Command" design pattern.
 *
 * Finite-state machine is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be
 * in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state
 * to another in response to some external inputs.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Finite-state machine - Wikipedia</a>
 *
 * "Command" pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate
 * all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Command pattern - Wikipedia</a>
 *
 * Also this package contains various components that are required for implementation work.
