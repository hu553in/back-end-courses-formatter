/**
 * This package contains IToken interface and it's implementation(-s?).
 *
 * Lexical token is a string with an assigned and thus identified meaning.
 * It is structured as a pair consisting of token name and lexeme.
 *
 * The token name is a category of lexical unit. It is what might be termed "a part of speech" in linguistics.
 *
 * A lexeme is a sequence of characters in the source program that matches the pattern for a token
 * and is identified by the lexical analyzer as an instance of that token.
